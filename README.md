Fair warning-- this project is not fully finished!!
It's almost done, just missing some advanced design/responsive CSS.
It's still functional, just not 100% done. There's some filler images (stock images) in there, but (again) they don't take away from the functionality.
I still hope you can consider it!! <3

# The WHAT
## What is my project?
My project is a website I made for my school robotics team! 
Featuring who we are, what we do, challenges we've participated in, and community outreach, among other things!

# The WHY
## Why did I make this project?
I made this project because, honestly, our old website was UGLY. It was a halfhearted google sites creation that both looked ugly and hardly functioned.
I was asked by a friend to make a website for the team, and as someone who loves both functionality and design, I needed to fix this.

# The HOW
## How did I make this project?
I made this project with HTML, CSS, and JS, using GSAP with JS for more complex animations.
The project is all frontend-- no backend necessary, really.

# What did I struggle with?
I struggled a lot with trying to get GSAP to function the way I wanted it to.
I usually use plain JS for my animations, but I wanted to start teaching myself GSAP, since it's not only much quicker and organized, but also allows for much more variety of animations.
However, GSAP was pretty tricky at times (especially because I've never used it this extensively)! I struggle da little with achieving the exact animations I wanted, but I got it after a little bit of trial and error.
Setting up responsive CSS was sometimes tricky as well, but that was more based on it being tedious rather than difficult.
